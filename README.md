The project is a desktop music application inspired by Spotify. It is developed in C++ and designed using Qt Creator for the graphical user interface (GUI). 
It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of songs, enabling them to manage their music library efficiently. Other functionalities are sorting by title/artist, creating a random playlist with a chosen number of songs or view the lyrics of a selected song.
The application features sophisticated undo and redo functionalities, allowing users to revert or reapply their actions, thereby offering a flexible and user-friendly experience.
